Install Notes
-------------

1. Create a new Yammer user that will post all of your commit messages by proxy (e.g. git@organization.tld)

2. Login as this user and go to https://www.yammer.com/client_applications/new

3. Create a new application, for example:

    Application name: organization-git  
    Author:  organization  
    Author Email:  git@organization.tld  
    Main Application URL:  http://organization.tld/  

4. Save the returned Consumer (Application) Key and Consumer (Application) Secret.  You will need them for the next step.

5. Authorize the application.  You can do this by using the yammer_create_oauth_yml.rb script of the yammer4r gem.

6. Enter the output of step 5 (consumer key+secret and access token+secret) into your github service hook form for yammer.
